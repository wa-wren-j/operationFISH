hi!

im still learning how github works so this setup is a lil funky

the main branch was the first iteration of the code, and i made a second branch but it includes the files from the main branch
except the second branch is the second iteration

so if you download the zip for the second branch just ignore the folder named 'code' (delete it, actually, that might be better)
because thats the first iteration and i dont know how to get rid of it on this branch

-W :]
